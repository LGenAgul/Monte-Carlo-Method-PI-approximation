Monte Carlo Simulation for Approximating π

This C++ project utilizes the Monte Carlo method to approximate the value of π (pi). It employs SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphical visualization. The simulation generates random points within a square and determines how many fall within a quarter circle, allowing for an estimation of π. The results are displayed in real-time using SFML graphics.

Key Features:

Monte Carlo simulation for π approximation.
Graphical visualization using SFML.
Real-time display of the number of points, colors representing inclusion/exclusion in the sector, and the approximate value of π.

Instructions:
Clone the repository.
Build and run the C++ program.
Or just go straight into the x64/Release/monte carlo.exe
